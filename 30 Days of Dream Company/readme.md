## 30 DAYS OF DREAM COMPANY ROADMAP 

[BIG O CHEATSHEET](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)


- We will cover main topics in 30 days, and 
- We will target the interviews of big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. 

### Few things to need to keep in mind before we continue with the roadmap…

- If you’re a beginner then make the target to solve almost 450-500 coding questions.
- If you’re an experienced person then make the target to solve almost 300 to 350 questions.
- System design round is mostly asked from experienced people so beginners have to focus on this section less but experienced one has to focus on this section more.
- If you’re a beginner then try to commit your time for at least 4-6 hours every day.
- If you’re an experienced one then you need to commit for 2-3 hours every day.
- Ideally, you shouldn’t take more than 20–30 minutes to solve any given problem but keep in mind that this rule is not applicable to all the questions. 

- **Prerequisites**: We are assuming that if you’re a beginner then you already have completed some projects in your college and if you’re an experienced developer then surely you might be working on some projects.
