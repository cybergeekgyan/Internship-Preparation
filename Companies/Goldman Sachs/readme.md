## Experience - 1 

### Round 1 (Online Assessment Test): Platform was HackerRank with tab proctoring and webcam proctoring enabled. This round consisted of 5 sections(There was section-wise time limit)

**Section 1:**

- 2 coding questions of moderate level (Time: 30 Minutes)
- 5 languages allowed: CPP, java, java8, python, python3

**Section 2: (Maths and Quant):**

- Marking: +5,-2
- Time: 25 min
- 8 MCQs
- Questions on probability, combinatorics, binomial theorem, etc.

**Section 3: (CS MCQs):**

- Marking:+5,-2
- Time: 20 min
- 7 MCQs
- Based on topics like Data structures, Algorithms, OS, Networking, etc.

**Section 4:**

- The Advanced Programming Section had 1 programming question.
- Time: 45 mins.

Section 5:

- 2 value-based type questions each having 10 marks(to be answered in brief)
- Time: 15 min
- The questions of section 5 were as follows:

*Suppose you and your friend are doing an important project having some deadline. Then suddenly your friend left the project in the middle because of some unavoidable reasons. What will you do in that situation?

*Mention one instance where you were highly motivated and excited for a project and you achieved exceptional results in it.*
Shortlist Criteria, GS follow GPA+TEST Score. 54 students were shortlisted for the next Rounds.

### Round 2 Technical Interview (35 minutes): Platform was Zoom for video Call and HackerRank CodePair for coding.

This round began with a formal introduction, followed by a few questions related to the work I have done as Technical Head in the Placement Cell during Under Graduation. Then, he asked me how much I rate myself in problem-solving and coding skills and justify why I think so.

Then, he asked to write code for the problem:

Sort the array of strings according to the new alphabetical order. New alphabetical order starts with a given character â€˜câ€™.
I wrote the code for the same using Bubble Sort and wrote a compare function according to the new alphabetical order. The interviewer then asked me to explain the time complexity of the sorting algorithm and also a few other questions related to other sorting algorithms like which are better in which scenarios etcâ€¦

I used the hashing concept in the compare function and an array for the same, he then asked me to write code without using any extra space and asked me to explain time and space complexity.

After that, he asked me If I had any questions to ask.




This round went very well, and I was selected for the next round.

### Round 3 Technical Interview (60 minutes): The Interviewer had my CV this time. He started by asking me about the experience of the previous Interview round.

He then asked me to Introduce myself and asked to tell more about my strengths, language preferences, and technical skills.

Then for the next 20-25 minutes, he asked questions related to the project I mentioned. He particularly asked me to explain in detail the part of the project that my other teammate did. He also asked questions like what I learned from this, what was the motive behind this etcâ€¦

Since I mentioned in my introduction that I had an interest in the Data Science Field, he asked a few questions related to data mining, data pre-processing, machine learning algorithms, libraries used for the same, etc.

Then he asked me a few questions like:

How could you be an asset to the company?
How do you think this Internship could help you?
What makes you think you are a good team player and have good coordination skills?
He then asked me to solve the problem: 

Given a sorted array that is rotated by k places in a clockwise direction, find the value of k in the most optimal way.
(In my case, HackerRank Codepair was not working, for the interviewer, at that time. So, he just asked me to explain my approach)

I initially gave a simple O(n) solution. But I immediately realised that it is not the most optimal solution, then I was able to give an O(logn) solution similar to binary search after some time. After that, I explained itâ€™s Time Complexity.

In the end, he asked if I had any questions. 

This was the end of the Interview Rounds for me, and I was selected. ðŸ™‚ (Fourth Round was also conducted for many students.)

Aftermath: They selected 9 students for the Internship.

+> *Few Takeaways which might help:*

Do not panic and Remain calm. Be Honest(in both Resume and during the Interview).
Listen to the PPTs of the companies properly.
While you are solving a question, speak to the interviewer.
Data Structures, Problem Solving is very important. Good CGPA helps, personal projects, extracurricular activities would also give you an edge.
