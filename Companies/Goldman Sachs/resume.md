Your Resume/CV is a key part of your Goldman Sachs application.  Therefore it's very important to build a successful Resume/CV that is well-written, clear and concise.  Based on our experience reviewing numerous applications, we have outlined some Resume/CV best practices and winning strategies below.
Format

The information on your Resume/CV should be as readable and aesthetically pleasing as possible with a measured balance between text and space
The standard length of a Resume/CV for a graduate application is one page.  Everything included in your Resume/CV should add value
Think about the points you consider particularly important.  Block capitals, different size fonts and bold or italic type can help to direct the reviewer's focus. Use with moderation and be consistent in your formatting
Avoid lengthy paragraphs; bullet points can be used to condense a list of details
Personal Details

Include your name, address, at least one email address, a home telephone number and a mobile telephone number
Be sure that all of your contact details are correct and up-to-date
Ensure that your e-mail address projects a professional image of yourself

List your educational details in reverse order, with your most recent experiences first, back to your secondary level education
Integrate your education institutions and qualifications into one section
Highlight any positions of responsibility you may have held
Employment History/Work Experience

Especially if your career has been short to date, give details of all jobs and positions held.  Include part time and unpaid work, starting with your current or most recent employer
Work experience should not be limited to paid employment.  Include any volunteer work,  positions of responsibility within societies
This section can be used by reviewers to target your Resume/CV for particular positions at Goldman Sachs.   Use the experiences that you do have to talk about any relevant or transferable skills
Do not use valuable space to include the full addresses of your past employers
Personal Development/Skills

Write about any courses, societies, voluntary work or responsibilities you consider relevant
Sell any transferable or technical skills acquired
Before You Submit

Spell check!
Print out a copy and ask yourself the following questions:
     1. Will a recruiter find my Resume/CV easy to read and impactful?
     2. Is the content concise and effective?
     3. Is the application a good reflection of me and my experiences?
Ask a friend or colleague to read the document and ask them the same set of questions
