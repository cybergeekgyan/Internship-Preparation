### Building an Application

- Here is the list of items that you are going to need when developing Android applications. 
- Please note that, this is an exhaustive list, and you don't need to know it all from the get-go. 
- Get an idea of the items listed, and just start building some apps and keep the items listed in the back of your mind and have a deep dive when using them.
